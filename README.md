# DockedWindows

This is just the goofy port in Java of a proof of concept in C++ made to answer
[this StackOverflow question about Qt and docked windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7528612/how-to-make-two-side-by-side-qt-windows-sticky-and-act-like-a-single-window/52798335#52798335).

The original code may be found [here](https://github.com/Shub77/DockedWindows) (Github).

Since Java is no more supported in Qt5, I made two thread objects that simply change an attribute to each other.
